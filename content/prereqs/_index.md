Prerequisites
=============

To complete the walkthrough below you will need:

-   The [AWS CLI version 2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/install-cliv2.html) installed on your local machine. Ensure it's the latest
    version so it supports Wavelength.

-   An AWS account with sufficient privileges to create VPC
    resources (instances, subnets, etc).

- An SSH key pair in the Region you wish to use for the tutorial.

- An understanding of how to SSH into Linux instances. Check the [documentation](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/AccessingInstancesLinux.html) if you need more information. 


The workshop uses the AWS CLI and the commands provided work on Mac and Linux machines. If you are on a Windows machine the easiest way to run through the tutorial is to spin up a Linux-based EC2 instance, and run the commands from the EC2 instance's command line.
